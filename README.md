## Quick Start

Each tutorial includes detailed instructions for:

1. **Environment Setup**: Required API keys and configuration
2. **Installation**: Dependencies and package management
3. **Running the Agent**: Starting the server with proper credentials
4. **Running the Client**: Testing the protected endpoints
5. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## Common Environment Variables

Most tutorials require:

**Server-side (Agent/Builder)**:
```bash
NVM_API_KEY=your-builder-api-key        # or BUILDER_NVM_API_KEY
NVM_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id
NVM_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox                 # or live
```

**Client-side (Subscriber)**:
```bash
SUBSCRIBER_NVM_API_KEY=your-subscriber-key
NVM_PLAN_ID=your-plan-id
NVM_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id
```

**Additional**:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                   # For LangChain tutorials
PORT=3000                               # Server port
```

## Testing with Stripe

For development and testing, use Stripe's test card:

- **Card Number**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiry**: Any future date
- **CVC**: Any 3-digit number
